✅ FIXED: Payment redirect issue resolved

**Problem:** After completing payment in Stripe, users were not being redirected back to the website.

**Solution:** 
- Replaced Payment Links with Checkout Sessions for more reliable redirect support
- Payment Links created via API sometimes don't respect `after_completion` redirects
- Checkout Sessions with `success_url` and `cancel_url` properly redirect users after payment
- Updated webhook to handle line items expansion and fallback to metadata

**Changes made:**
1. Modified `/app/api/checkout/payment-link/route.ts` to use Checkout Sessions instead of Payment Links
2. Added proper `success_url` and `cancel_url` configuration
3. Updated webhook to expand line items and fallback to metadata if needed

**Testing:**
- After payment completion, users should be redirected to `/credits?success=true`
- PaymentSuccessHandler component will show a success toast
- Credits will be added to user account via webhook
