# Video History UX/UI Decision

## Current State
- ✅ Profile page shows ALL videos (all statuses: completed, processing, failed)
- ✅ Generate page only shows the form (no video history)

## Proposed Solution: **Option 3 - Split View**

### Recommendation: Show completed videos in Generate, full history in Profile

**Rationale:**
1. **Generate Page** - Show recently completed videos (last 5-10)
   - Provides inspiration while creating new videos
   - Quick access to recent successful work
   - Motivates users to see their completed creations
   - Clean, focused view without clutter

2. **Profile Page** - Show full history with filters
   - Complete record of all videos (completed, processing, failed)
   - Filter by status (All, Completed, Processing, Failed)
   - Better for account management and history review
   - More comprehensive view for users who want to see everything

### Benefits:
- ✅ Better UX: Users see their successful videos where they create new ones
- ✅ Clear separation: Quick view vs. complete history
- ✅ Motivation: Seeing completed videos encourages more generation
- ✅ Organization: Failed/processing videos don't clutter the creative space

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Create Reusable Video List Component** (`components/video-list.tsx`)
   - Accepts videos array and display options
   - Handles different statuses (completed, processing, failed)
   - Reusable for both pages

2. **Update Generate Page** (`app/generate/page.tsx`)
   - Fetch only completed videos (limit 10, most recent)
   - Show below the form or in a sidebar
   - Title: "Recent Videos" or "Your Creations"

3. **Update Profile Page** (`app/profile/page.tsx`)
   - Keep full history but add status filter tabs
   - Show: All | Completed | Processing | Failed
   - Better organization and filtering

## Alternative Options Considered:

### Option 1: Keep everything in Profile
- ❌ Users have to navigate away to see their work
- ❌ Less inspiring when creating new videos
- ✅ Simple, single location

### Option 2: Move everything to Generate
- ❌ Clutters the generation page
- ❌ Failed/processing videos distract from creation
- ❌ Less organized

### Option 3: Split View (RECOMMENDED) ✅
- ✅ Best of both worlds
- ✅ Contextual display based on page purpose
- ✅ Better user experience

## Implementation Status

- [x] ✅ Create reusable `VideoList` component (`components/video-list.tsx`)
- [x] ✅ Add completed videos section to Generate page (`app/generate/page.tsx`)
- [x] ✅ Add status filters to Profile page (`components/video-history-filters.tsx`)
- [x] ✅ Update Profile page to use new filter component
- [ ] Test both views
- [ ] Update navigation if needed

## Implementation Details

### Components Created:

1. **`components/video-list.tsx`**
   - Reusable component for displaying video grids
   - Handles different video statuses (completed, processing, failed)
   - Shows appropriate UI for each status (spinner for processing, error icon for failed)
   - Configurable: max videos, empty messages, styling

2. **`components/video-history-filters.tsx`**
   - Tab-based filtering component
   - Filters: All | Completed | Processing | Failed
   - Shows count badges for each filter
   - Uses the reusable `VideoList` component

### Pages Updated:

1. **`app/generate/page.tsx`**
   - Fetches last 6 completed videos
   - Displays them in a "Your Recent Creations" card below the form
   - Only shows completed videos (no failed/processing clutter)
   - Provides inspiration while creating

2. **`app/profile/page.tsx`**
   - Uses new `VideoHistoryFilters` component
   - Shows all videos with filter tabs
   - Complete history with better organization
   - Users can filter by status to find specific videos

### User Experience:

**Generate Page:**
- Clean, focused video creation form
